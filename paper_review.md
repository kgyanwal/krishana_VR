Building long-term empathy: A large-scale comparison of traditional and virtual reality perspective-taking


## Introduction/Overview

Virtual Reality (VR) has given importance not only to the technical simulation of the environment but also to teach users empathy. A dictionary definition from Merriam-Webster on Empathy is ‘the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner.” This definition is long; however, it captures all the required ingredients that the term empathy beholds. In short, it can be generalized as the internalization of other’s feelings without being judgmental of their thoughts and actions. 

The research says that VR as the ‘ultimate empathy machine’, that allows user to unleash their experience from any point of view. Empathy is the ability to understand someone else’s emotions. In a 3D environment, people move freely and interacts with their simulated environment. VR’s ability to present the user on the scene and the feeling inside the integrated virtual environment allows understanding others than themselves. VR investment from HTC (VR for Impact) and Oculus (bought by Facebook in 2014, 2B) can be used to promote social equality and empathy. 

## Motivation

The traditional approach of perspective-taking, in which the human subjects are asked to imagine in certain circumstances, has helped to reduce prejudice and negative stereotypes, and motivated people for altruistic behavior. The sharing of information on news media about natural disasters increases empathy. In the same way, the interactive interface in the virtual world (virtual narrative) has been found as an effective tool to promote empathy. 

## Research Subjects and the implementation process

This study has people to get a perspective on the people who are homeless and evicted from their house. It has selected 100 participants for two months initially. Then, 1000 participants from the Bay Area of SF. Both of these research’s outcomes show that there is a significant difference found in attitude towards homeless people. 

## Why VR is good for teaching empathy

1.	Being social
2.	Higher interaction means a higher feeling of presence or feeling on the actual situation (being there) and better engagement with the events with a personalized experience. 
3.	Higher cognitive ability has increased interactivity, which shows empathy towards the protagonist. 

## Shortcomings
1.	One time of a person’s opinion does not determine the person beholds the same opinion in the future. 
2.	Small Sample size: 100 or 1000 is still a small sample size. 
3.	Qualitative phenomena are always challenging to measure in the long run because the human’s feeling is so volatile. 
4.	The study is still homogenous because it has captured the feeling of SF bay area people, it is hard to generalize to the larger audience with the same empathy score. 

## NARRATIVE: “The narrative begins with the participants sitting in their apartment after losing their job and realizing rent is due. Despite selling most of their belongings, participants are not able to raise enough money to pay rent and are evicted from their apartment. Forced to live out of their car, they prepare themselves for the night by trying to find their toothbrush and other items needed to brush their teeth. Participants suddenly hear a police siren and are approached by a police officer who discovers the participants are living out of their car. Due to a city ordinance prohibiting the use of cars as homes in public spaces, the car is impounded. Participants are now traveling on a bus at night for shelter and warmth, when they are warned that there are two men onboard who may serve as a threat to them. One man may try to get unpleasantly close to the participant while the other may try to steal the participant’s backpack. In the bus, participants also interact with other non-threatening homeless people and learn about their experiences.”

3.	Participant’s point of view in the bus scene. 

## Analysis:
•	Inclusion of the Other in the self
•	Empathy
•	Personal distress
•	Social Presence Scale
•	Attitudes towards the homeless
•	Behavioral measures 
•	Donation questions
•	Letter Writing

Future work

•	Since the study is already working to minimize racial issues using VR, it could be useful for many companies to save a lot of money because they have repetitive causes of racial issues and they end up paying a lot of money in the lawsuit. It is because the research has shown the empathy has increased over time. 


## Conclusion

Though the research shows promising results, it is yet to cover more geographic areas. This research can be expended and utilized by industries especially for the staff training to minimize the enterprise risk. It is also can be useful for social well-being for every individual.

## Notes: -

Sympathy vs. Empathy
Sympathy and empathy are closely related words, bound by shared origins and the similar circumstances in which each is applicable, yet they are not synonymous. For one thing, sympathy is considerably older than empathy, having existed in our language for several hundred years before its cousin was introduced, and its greater age is reflected in a wider breadth of meaning. Sympathy may refer to "feelings of loyalty" or "unity or harmony in action or effect," meanings not shared by empathy. In the contexts where the two words do overlap, sympathy implies sharing (or having the capacity to share) the feelings of another, while empathy tends to be used to mean imagining, or having the capacity to imagine, feelings that one does not actually have.
